My name is Laurence Miguel A. Ibarra and I am an aspiring Computer Engineer
-  ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ I am from the Philippines
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring Embedded Systems, FPGA Programming using Verilog and Microcontroller Programming.
- ðŸŒ± Next stop: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to embed in my future embedded projects.

As I embark on my journey as a computer engineer, my goal is to specialize in embedding machine learning and artificial intelligence into small, power-efficient, and memory-efficient systems. With a keen interest in hardware and software development for embedded systems, I aspire to gain expertise in HDL (Hardware Description Language) and FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) programming through dedicated learning and practical experience in hopes to design custom microprocessor architectures and hardware accelerators optimized for machine learning tasks. By focusing on minimizing resource usage while maximizing performance, I envision contributing to the advancement of efficient and low-power AI integration in embedded systems, ultimately enhancing their capabilities for various IoT applications.
